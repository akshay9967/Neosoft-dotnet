## Final Assessment
### Topic - World Trainers
- Finding trainers for inhouse training is always a task for tech companies. Create an app to light this load where:
  - clients and trainers can register themselves,
  - A trainer after registeration and upload its tech skills for better search, update details on experience, education background etc 
  - *(optional) Client upon login can look into some trainer/instructors basic profile (experience and education), filter it based on skills and experience,*
- Login can be a very simple without using any auth framework.
- Finally, deploy this app to Azure App service and share this in into your readMe files and on slack.

### Models
- Trainer/User
- Trainer Details
- *(optional) Client*

### Views and user story
- On first request land user to Login/SignUp Page
- SignUp as Trainer
  - Login as Trainer
  - Add Profile (such as experience, skills and education)
  - View profile or details of themselves
  - Edit profile
- *(optional) SignUp as Client*
  - *Login as client* 
  - *On Login should list all trainers*
  - *search box should enable client to search a trainer by name or skills*
  - *client should be able to see details of the trainer (experience, education and skills)*

### Note

- Create a new team repo named P2-{team-name} on github org [Tech Training](https://github.com/Tech-Training-2021)
- Make sure all git operations working before you start to code
- Avoid merge conflicts
- make frequent small commits and push
- Keep deploying your app from the begining and publish often when some changes has occured.
- make sure you all distribute your work so that no one is burderned
- once you complete your task share the link of your deployed app on zoom

### Other Requirements 
- Exception Handling 
- Input validation
- Data should be persisted, (no data should be hard coded) 
- You should use a DB to store data 
- If you are using code-first approach then add migrations or if you are using DbFirst the add the ER diag as well as db script
